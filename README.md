My first project about Frauds Classification using YOLOv3 + library Alibi-Detect
Detail about project. Project using model Variational Auto-Encoder to reconstructs input image and calculate error between input image and reconstruct image then classification. If error is greater than threshold, input image will be anomaly else normaly
